After years of experience in programming, I decided to concentrate more on design skills. So I have been trying to learn design skills from so many months. But there isn't single thing to follow which will make you a better designer. 

Finally, I decided to have a mentor and start from very basic. I decided to learn sketching and then slowly I will progress to design. And most of it will be a practical rather than just theory.

My Mentor is Mayur, he has more than 8 years of experience in design field. He specializes in Mural - Art of painting walls. But he agreed with me to teach me pencil works.

I am hoping that some people will definitely get benefited with my experience and learning in this process. So I am sharing my daily experiences with beginning of design. 

## My Goal
Just like programming, drawing and paintings are vast fields. If I will not concentrate on particular art or style, I will end up mastering nothing. So I discussed with my mentor, what I wanted to learn particularly.

So we decided to learn basic sketching, cartoon creation, basic coloring, but will more concentrate on drawing cartoons. 

## Understanding Tools and Game Plan

One of the most important in learning any art is practice. No matter how many theories you lean, you have to make your hands dirty and practice, practice, practice.

### Tools you will need

- Pencils : H, HB, HB2, HB3, HB4, HB6 and HB8.
- Large eraser - good quality
- Cutter - for sharpening pencils
- Drawing Book - Quarter size, approximately 100 pages

### Practice Schedule
So whatever practice will be given for first few days, I will have to be practicing for *next 15 days, for at least an hour*.

### How to hold a pencil

Mayur taught me two main ways to hold pencils. First is the regular way and other is with [Gesture Method](http://kurtbrugel.deviantart.com/art/Holding-the-pencil-for-Gesture-Drawing-280520310). 

>Mayur didn't tell me the reason why to hold pencils like this, but told me specifically to practice each thing in both ways.

## Homework for Day 1
**Instructions:** Make sure you do not move your paper for any of this practice. The paper should stay in the same way. Only your hand should move. 

- take a practice paper, preferably A4 size blank paper. Draw a horizontal line from left to right. Now. It shouldn't be too slow, or too fast. 
- Now Draw a parallel line below first line. and repeat till the page gets filled.
- Now turn the page and start drawing lines from right to left.
- Repeat similar for top to bottom lines, bottom to top lines (verticle lines)
- Similarly, repeat for cross lines in forward slash (/) and backward slash (\\), in both directions
