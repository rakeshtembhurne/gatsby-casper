[![Facebook apps posting who viewed profile and events created](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/facebook_virus_few_more-300x232.jpg \"Facebook Who Viewed My Profile Spam\")](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/facebook_virus_few_more.jpg)

These days, Facebook is full of some weird problems which are so irritating that some of my friends are now talking about removing people from their friends list who are carelessly contributing to spam. **Almost all the problems are due to adding some insecure Facebook Application** to your profile.

These applications behave similar to worms (cousins of viruses) which **replicate themselves on specific triggers**. All they need is just permission from a user. The interesting thing is these applications are so lucrative or carefully written that most people give access to these application without even giving it a thought.

I did some research and found some of the common patterns of these viral Facebook Applications.

## Who Viewed Your Profile

[![Facebook Applications lieing about being official](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/official_facebook_app_lie.jpg \"Official Facebook Application Lie\")](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/official_facebook_app_lie.jpg)

This is the most common way of attracting people. The social networking sites like [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/ \"LinkedIn - They support official 'who viewed your profile' functionality\") provides this functionality of knowing how many people have visited the website. The spammers have found the nerve here. I understand how curious people go over *who is secretly keeping an eye over me* kind of things.

These applications now have gone one step further calling themselves **Official Facebook Who Viewed Your Profile Application**. But this is a lie as Facebook has already made it clear that they don’t support this feature.

> Facebook does not provide the ability to track who is viewing your profile, or parts of your profile, such as your photos. Applications by outside developers cannot provide this functionality, either.

## I Can’t Believe It

[![Facebook App Claiming Free Gifts](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/facebook_free_gift_lie.jpg \"Facebook Free Gift Spam\")](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/facebook_free_gift_lie.jpg)

These are another applications which makes **false claims that your friend has got FREE gift**. They provide you a link, on clicking they will ask for your permission and voila, you got a free gift! At least they will tell your friends so. That’s it. All you have done, is just given permission to write on your wall and access your information anytime, and now this application will **steal all the information about you**, your friends and post on your friends’ wall that you have to a gift.


## What The Heck Are You Doing

These applications will tag your friends in a photo or video and will post on your wall along with a line curious enough to let you click on it. Once you click on it, the same process will continue as in above cases.


## Facebook WOW Events

Similar to above problems, this is another annoying side of some irritating Facebook Applications. These applications will **constantly be creating events at regular interval**, asking you to come to fake events.

These events keeps notifying and inviting you as soon as somebody accepts access to such annoying applications.
