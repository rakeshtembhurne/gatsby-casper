## Framework and Runtime Environments

### Microsoft .NET Framework

Most of the software are developed using some kind of Frameworks or libraries. [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/ \".NET Framework\") is Microsoft’s own framework and most of the windows software are build with  .NET Framework.

### Java Runtime Environment

Just like .NET Framework, [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.java.com/getjava/index.jsp \"JRE Sofware\") (JRE) is build by Sun Microsystem for rapid software development. The reason developers prefer JDK over .NET is the ability of software to work cross platform with no or little change. Many popular software are build with Java, so installing this framework will help them run smoothly.

## Must Have Free Security Software

## Must have Free Multimedia Software

### VLC Media Player

Different kinds of media (.wma, mp3, mp4, etc) requires different codecs. Codecs are nothing but the ways of recognizing and playing media types. [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ \"VLC Media Player software\") is a popular application that requires no external codecs to play most of the common media files.

### Winamp

[Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/ \"Winamp media player\") music player for Windows and Android is noted for its graphical sound visualization, playlist, and media library features. It supports popular playback types, viz.,  AAC, M4A, MP3, MIDI, MOD, MPEG-1, FLAC, WMA and WAV.

### K-Lite Mega Codec Pack

This is a big free collection of media codecs. It can install media player classic with the codec or you may choose Windows Media Player to play all media files.

It is very easy to install and download this application and also it’s size is smaller compared to most of other software in this category. It has all the features that a regular computer user needs.

## Must Have Free Internet Software

### Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome

I leave the choice on you. The reason I mentioned two browsers is that [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/ \"Mozill Firefox Browser\") has been the most preferred, well known for security free browser available. It is the most used browser till date. But with the entry and the constant growth of [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome \"Google Chrome Browser\") is worth noticing. So the choice is tough but clearly both are better than Internet Explorer.

### Free Download Manager

Free Download Manager is one of the best download manager available. It not only improves the download speed but also helps you pause and re-download multiple things simultaneously.

### uTorrent

Torrents are preferred for large download and [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/ \"uTorrent - a tiny bitTorrent application\") is a very popular choice for downloading the .torrent files. It is a small and feature rich application that helps you download torrents.

\n## Must Have Free Miscellaneous Software

### Foxit Reader

I became fan of [Foxit Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/reader/ \"Foxit Reader - lightweight PDF reader\") when I compared the features provided by this software with other popular PDF readers. Foxit reader is a lightweight PDF reader which is not short of features. It is surprising to see how it gives you ability to leave and share comments on pdf file. You can also edit PDF files with limited permissions.
