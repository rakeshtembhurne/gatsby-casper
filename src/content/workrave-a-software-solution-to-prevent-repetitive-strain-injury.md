Personal Computers have become integral part of our lives. Not only they have changed the way we live but also changed the way we work on day to day basis. These **changes in methods of working are causing health problems** such as Repetitive Strain Injury also known as RSI.

> RSI is an injury of the muscles, bones and nervous systems that may be caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, pressing against hard surfaces, or sustained or awkward positions. RSI is believed to be caused due to lifestyle without ergonomic care, e.g. while working in front of computers, driving, traveling etc.

The following image will give you idea of ideal ways to use personal computers. If you are interested in knowing more, Wikipedia page about [Repetitive Strain Injury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury \"RSI on Wikipedia\") might help.

## Recovery and Prevention of RSI

Couple of weeks ago, I have also written about an application which helps you [manage super secure passwords that you can carry with you](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/online-security/managing-super-secure-passwords-create-store-use-carry-passwords-simplest-way/ \"Manage secure passwords with Password Manager\"). This time we will see a new useful application that will help you take care of your health.

[Workrave](http://www.workrave.org/ \"Workrave Application - Fight RSI\") is an application I am using since a year. It helps in the recovery and prevention of Repetitive Strain Injury. This application is designed in such a way that it monitors amount of time you spend over your PC. Workrave is capable of alerting you at regular interval, forcing you to take some micro-pauses.

Surely, taking micro-pauses helps breaking ‘repetitive’ works, but you will also need to take big rest breaks. You can even customize the time intervals and total time as daily limit. Another important feature it contains is the quick overview of exercises. When a rest break occurs, it shows you some of the exercises which are very easy to do. This application is available for GNU/Linux as well as Windows platform for free of cost.
