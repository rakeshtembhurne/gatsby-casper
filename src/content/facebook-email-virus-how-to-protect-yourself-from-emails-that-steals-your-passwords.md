Sending fake emails and trapping you in some game is the old method used by virus makers. At some instances, you can clearly identify that the email is fake or not, but it may  not be possible every time. The best way to protect yourself from such fake emails that can make you to install viruses, is to keep yourself informed.

When I was writing about some [Facebook viruses that annoys friends and steals your data](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/online-security/facebook-applications-that-might-annoy-your-friends/ \"Facebook Viral Applications that Annoy your friends\"), I shared some ways that some virus makers are using to create Facebook applications just to steal your data by spreading itself on the Facebook. In this post I am going to explain the ways by which some of the viruses spread via emails.

## Working Method of Facebook Email Viruses

[![Facebook Email Viruses - How they work](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/working_method_of_facebook_email_viruses.png \"Working Methods of Facebook Email Viruses\")](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/working_method_of_facebook_email_viruses.png)

1. **Getting your name, email and personal data** is the first step. Even if you did not make any mistake, one wrong click of your Facebook friend can give access to your personal data, which you assumed you are only sharing with your friends. So if you did not manually tighten your Facebook privacy settings, you are always in a situation to compromise your privacy in a way or other.
2. **They send you email** with a valid reason which may trigger your emotions. The reasons why they trigger emotions because it increases the chances of your reaction. They commonly use very similar emails that Facebook sends you as notifications with some tricky content in it. Few common tricks they use: - You have been recorded on photo / camera in doing something wrong and everybody knows it now\n- Someone got access to your account and changed your password. The only way to get back your password is to click the link\n- Something is wrong with your Facebook account, so your account will be deleted if you won’t do what has been stated in the email
3. Inside the email they **will motivate you to click a link or download an attachment **that either claims to be a solution of the problem or the only way to recover your loss. The links will take you to the websites with some possible scenarios like 1. You must add your private details, like username, passwords, security questions or any other hints that will be used to get control over your account
4. You will be told that some files must be downloaded and installed. For example you will be shown a page with a video claiming that a plugin need to be installed or updated in order to view that page.

## Practical Tips to Protect Yourself From Facebook Email Viruses

Making you enter your personal data, or installing viral applications on your computer, are two major goals of any virus maker. Understanding this motive you can now protect yourself against such situations.

Making some habits to check genuineness of emails will not only save you from Facebook Email Viruses but also will protect you from such other fake email threats.

1. **Don’t rush to respond**. Don’t just believe blindly what is said in the email, instead wait and think about it for couple of second.
2. **Check where links are pointing**. Just hover on the link and your browser will tell you the actual link where you will go when clicked that link. Almost all the browsers supports this feature. If you find difference between the title and the actual link address, do not click the link.
3. **Manually write website address** in address bar. Even if you are sure about genuineness of the email, don’t just click on the links in email, but try to go by manual method. If you see the mail is from Facebook, just enter facebook.com in browser and log in. You will get the same notifications there. This will save you from accidental mistakes.
4. **Spelling or grammatical mistake**s are the signs of vulnerabilities. This is not always true. But when you are receiving emails from trusted sources like Facebook, this becomes almost true.
5. **Difference between link title and link url** is also a sign of possible threat. When you hover over the link, you can see the actual url somewhere near bottom of your browser. If you wish to click, it is a good idea to first look at the link, and then decide to click or not.

By being little careful you can always improve your chances to stay secure from email threats.
