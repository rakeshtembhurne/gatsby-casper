I care for my online security. I have seen some of my friends’ mail and social networking accounts got hacked. Knowing that I thought I am smart that it won’t happen to me, and one day I found myself on earth when my email provider refused to log me in despite of all my efforts. And my **friends were getting some annoying emails** from that hacked account.

The moral of the story is, no matter how much intelligent we think we are, we still **need to play safe and care more when we are online**. Since then I started keeping myself updated with new technological things and actually using secure ways to be online.  Some [online safety rules you better not ignore](http://rakesh.tembhurne.com/online-security/online-safety-rules-you-better-not-ignore/ \"You should follow most of the online safety rules\"), else it could harm your personal, professional and social life in very bad way.

## Why Do You Need Secure Passwords?

Most of the users use **easy to remember passwords**, and the worst part if you know that person a bit, you can easily guess their passwords. The most common examples of worst passwords are *123456, password, password123, iloveyou* or name of someone very close to you, your phone number, your name followed by birth date, your nickname, etc.

Some people use plain English words in the password. I am a programmer and I know that **it takes few lines of codes and couple of minutes** to create a simple program that could match your id with your password. And with powerful computers of today, **it just will take seconds to hack your password** to an *evil minded cracker*.

## You, Yes You Should Use Password Manager?

Unless you are careless, dumb or over confident of being secure online, there’s no harm to give it a try. It will not only make your life simple and secure but also will save your valuable time and energy by remembering hundreds of complicated passwords.

## When and Where Can You Use Password Manager?

Anytime, anywhere. Not only you can install password managers on your Windows PC but also you can use it over your favorite Linux distribution. These applications allows you to import and export all your passwords to a single file which can be then used to carry in USB drives, send via emails or store in your computer.  Now a days password managers are also becoming common in mobile phones.

## Which Password Manager?

Enough said about Password Managers. It’s time to install and use it. My personal favorite is [KeePass Password Safe](http://keepass.info \"The Best Password Manager - KeePass Password Safe\"), which is completely free, updated regularly and is open source, which means its run by a community of people, programmers all over the world. It gives one shot
