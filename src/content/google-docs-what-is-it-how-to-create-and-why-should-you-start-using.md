Of course, Computers changed the way we work on day to day basis. We no longer need to keep messing with lots of papers and create them having pencils and pens in our hands. The tools like MS Office, Open Office are helping every business, either small or big. Creating, editing, printing and sharing documents, spreadsheets and presentations, schedules was never so easy in the history.

Most of us use desktop applications such as Microsoft Word or Open Office to create Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations. The problems with these desktop applications are you need to install them on a computer and at the most only one person can sit and work on it at a time.

> Google Docs is a free, Web-based word processor, spreadsheet, slide show, form, and data storage service offered by Google. It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real-time with other users.

With Google Docs you don’t need to install anything or pay money to buy license to use it. You can almost create, access documents from anywhere in the world, share them with friends and co-workers and do much more.
